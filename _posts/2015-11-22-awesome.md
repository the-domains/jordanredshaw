Find the places that make you the happiest; the back bowls of Lake Louise are some of mine.

_adjective _|_awe\*some _|_\\ˈȯ-səm\\_: causing feelings of fear and wonder : causing feelings of awe: extremely good

Awesome is one of my favourite words. Why? Because there are so many incredible places and experiences to be explored in this world.  Adventures can be found in our own backyards and cities, oceans and mountains and even within our own physical and mental limits. 

The people I've encountered on my journey have inspired me to push myself and to explore the world around me. I share my adventures in hope that I can pay this inspiration forward, whether it's to try something new at home or watching the sun come up on a remote coastline. 

Find the places where the ocean sings you to sleep, where the falling snow mutes the world around you, and where the sun warms your soul. Find the places and do the things that make you unable to wipe the smile off your face. 

Get outside. Get stoked. Get awesome.

Jordan
