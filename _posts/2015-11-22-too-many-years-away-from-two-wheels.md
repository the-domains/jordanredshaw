# too many years away from two wheels

> Getting back into mountain biking is easily one of the best things I did this year.

My brother ([Cameron][0]) and I both bought bikes this year and proceeded to spend countless hours riding, digging and laughing.

The highlight of the season was trying downhill riding for the first time at [Kicking Horse][1]. Cam and I made the roughly 12-hour trek from Fort McMurray to Golden, BC, with high hopes.

We rented bikes (make sure you book them beforehand) and signed up for a full-day lesson, which turned out to be private as we were the only too there who signed up in the intermediate/advanced category. Our instructor, Jordan, turned out to be a really awesome guy who guided us around the mountain and helped us improve our riding exponentially.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4ffaaa3e-38d8-46ec-aecb-45554ca0bce5.jpg)

The weather made for some interesting conditions but the day as a whole was incredibly fun; both my perspective on riding and confidence on the bike had completely changed for the better. 

A word of advice: get the insurance. I crashed hard after hitting a shark fin on my first run; destroying a pedal and bending a crank arm in the process. The guys in the shop were able to get it fixed up really quickly and at no extra cost ; I would have been out $500 without had I skimped on the insurance.

We've already begun the process of planning out a road trip for next summer and the next direction for the trail. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d8176f63-45f8-4f2e-851d-95ef82fc8dfd.jpg)

Happy trails!
